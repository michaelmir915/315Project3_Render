Sprint 3 minutes

Scrum 1:
In our initial sprint meeting, we discussed the main goals for this sprint. Michael and Tripper are going to finish up the Google Maps API, 
create the Interactive Pizza Builder, and finish the Customer GUI functions. Tosin will work on implementing the OAuth API for verification 
from the front page and implementing the Google Translate API for the Manager Side. Mark will focus on Front End CSS Styling and finishing up 
Manager Side functionality. Tuong will focus on implementing the Google Translate API for Server GUI and help Michael implement the Google 
Translate API for the Customer Side. He will also work with Mark to style the Server Side GUI and finish Server Side Functionality.

Scrum 2:
In our first scrum meeting, we reviewed the progress that each team member had made. The Customer Side had finished their order tracking, 
seasonal items, and implementing the Google Maps API. The manager side was working on the OAuth Login Implementation and the Server Side 
was working on its CSS Style Sheet. Before the Scrum 2 Meeting, we planned to style the main page, finish customer side backend functions, 
finish the server GUI style sheet, and work on the OAuth Implementation.

Scrum 3:
For the second scrum meeting, we reviewed the progress that each team member had made and focused on what needed to be done before  
the third and final scrum meeting. The major points were ironing out bugs and adding final smaller features, design choices (CSS), 
and finishing API implementation. We agreed that we should get everything done besides the google translate API if possible, 
as we can work together to finish that as all members needed it. All three views seemed to be nearing completion so we believe we are 
on track with our plans.
